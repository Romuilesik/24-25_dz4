## Why I Recommend Python 3.13

Based on my calculations, Python 3.13 is **2.2** times faster than Python 3.12! For the best user experience, I recommend using version 3.13 or higher. As of the time of writing, the latest Python version is 3.13.0.

## Why Python 3.7 or Higher is Required

Python 3.7 introduced several key improvements and new features that make the language more powerful and easier to use. These include:

- Data Classes: The @dataclass decorator simplifies the creation of classes intended for storing data.

- Delayed Evaluation of Type Annotations: Allows more flexibility in type annotations without circular imports.

- Context Variables: Introduced for better asynchronous programming.

- Improved Module Attributes: Enhanced module attributes, such as __getattr__.

Using Python 3.7 or higher ensures you have access to these enhancements and a more efficient programming experience.
